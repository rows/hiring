# Intro
Imagine a spreadsheet grid where each cell can also call an API or repeat a job. This is what we are building. Our product lets users create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills they already have. You can check us at [rows.com](http://rows.com).

# Your responsibilities

As a Product Manager, your role is to team up with a Engineering manager and Product Designer and make sure we build the best product. You will be in charge of product in one or more of our [teams](../Teams.md).

The main tasks of the Product Manager at Rows are:
* To write the story for each team. Who are we serving, what do they need, how do we plan to get there. This includes organizing a roadmap for the quarter and the future, but also other strategic documents (we love bold ideas!). For this, you will talk to people accross teams, users, check data and organize that into challenges. You will decide the priorities of the roadmap together with your team (not for them!). You will ensure that each roadmap item is described in a clear manner: what are we really trying to achieve? Why?
* To be the contact point for the team, inside and outside the company. You will write a short weekly update and be involved in cross team product discussions. You will talk with users and create your opinions.
* To be the driving force for problem solving and implementation decisions. You will express how much clarity there is on each to-do - if there's clarity, document it; if the team hasn't reached a conclusion yet, catalyze one by involving others (designers, users). As one of the key deciders, you will empower team colleagues (designers, engineers) by giving them the space to explore and impress, to decide scope, etc.

### Current open positions
* We are looking for Product Managers who will be a fit for our team F1. 
    * See what each Team does [here](../Teams.md).
    * For team F1 (functions and integrations) we are especially interested in product candidates that also want to attack the business side. You will be finding potential data partners, making deals with providers, including proposing ways to build data ourselves.
* Note: It is possible to move between teams. 

# About you
We're looking for people who improve our team! Our ideal buddy is:
* Motivated to solve complex challenges. We are building a platform that provides General Purpose Computing to the masses; this requires cooking up new solutions that handle millions of calculations.
* Professional and fun. We value commitment and the ability to stay optimistic and focused, especially in the face of difficult challenges or feedback. But we also find plenty of time to talk about The Big Lebowski.
* Focused on quality and usability. We hate alarms going off and features that are half-baked as much as you do. Come build a polished product with us!
