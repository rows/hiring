# Founding Account Executive

## Intro

Rows is the spreadsheet editor modern teams use to import, transform, and share data. 

Our mission is to empower the billion people out there working on a spreadsheet every day to work with their own data, making it accessible and actionable for everyone. 

## Your role

We have a freemium product that has traction, and we are improving that product-led growth model. 

On top of this, we want to start a viable sales channel for larger clients. As our Founding Sales Executive, you will be our first person in Sales. Your goal is to help us get the first 1 Million ARR in Enterprise customers. You will directly sell some of these contracts, and support the founders of Rows as they sell others. As this matures, we will create a playbook and process that we can build a team around. 

Over time, your mission will evolve and focus more and more on larger companies as Rows customers, and build your team. 

If you love spreadsheets and selling to people while building your own process this job is for you! If you do an amazing job, you might get the opportunity to build the Sales team.

## Your responsibilities

* Sell Rows directly to target users in target industries to build a new acquisition channel. You'll own a 360-degrees sales cycle - from generating leads to handoff to Customer Success at onboarding.
  * We expect that this will involve building lists, targeting leads, converting leads into onboarding calls and demos, experimenting, and closing contracts.
* Work with existing users who might be targets for larger contracts.
* Feed learnings from users and use cases back into our product roadmap.
* Give strategic input to founders including business opportunities, market focus, pricing, product roadmap, hiring, etc.

## About you

* You have experience in going from 0-1M ARR in Sales in SaaS or Software businesses.
* You are a hustler and a creative problem solver. We have a great product, paying customers, but don't the perfect path to a Sales channel yet.
* You are an excellent communicator in English.
* You understand sales methodologies and can build a sales process.
* You love spreadsheets, automation, productivity and analytics tools and can help others get the most out of them.
* As we get started, we very much prefer if you be close to one of the founders, that is, you'd be in Berlin (DE) or Porto (PT).

## Compensation and Perks

* Competitive salary with a significant share of performance based compensation.
* Employee equity plan.
* Liberal work-from-home (or remote) policy. 
* Unlimited vacation policy.
* A super experienced and motivated team that can't wait to work with you.
