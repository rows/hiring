### At Rows we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone.

**Rows is the easiest way for business users to work with data.**

Imagine a spreadsheet grid where each cell can also call an API or repeat a job. This is what we are building. Our product lets users create interactive spreadsheets using the spreadsheet skills they already have.

We are a venture-backed business, and Rows raised money from Cherry Ventures (seed), Accel (series A), Lakestar (series B), and Indico (new round), with strong participation of local funds Armilar and Shilling. We have been on the news and you can find us on [TechCrunch](https://tcrn.ch/3dEhNKD), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/23/rows-raises-16-million-and-launches-next-gen-spreadsheets-with-built-in-data-integrations/), [tech.eu](https://tech.eu/brief/rows-series-b/), [Eco Sapo (PT)](https://eco.sapo.pt/2021/02/23/rows-capta-13-milhoes-em-serie-b-para-continuar-a-fazer-crescer-equipa-e-produto-entre-o-porto-e-berlim/), [Business Insider (DE)](https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/rows-excel-konkurrent-finanzierung/) and many other media!
