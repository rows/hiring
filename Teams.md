The Rows organization is divided in teams (we call them Cells!).

Teams have a mission - a driving goal that provides clarity over the long term. 

| Team  | Focus                     | Mission                                                                | Locations               |

| S1    | Sales, Success, Support   | Increase revenue from customers who get high value-add from Rows.      | Berlin (DE)             |
| X1    | HR, Ops, Finance          | Build and support a world-class productivity team and company.         | Porto (PT), Berlin (DE) |

At Rows, teams enjoy a lot of ownership.
- For example, decisions inside Product teams are taken by the local Product Manager, Engineering Manager (Engineers) and Design lead as a group.
- We see Functions as the providers of technical guidance. They are excellence centers from which recommendations and technical feedback originates.

We have now started to structure our team around similar teams. Each group has a domain and a Manager (a mini-CEO of sorts).

| Group                 | Focus                                 | Teams      |
